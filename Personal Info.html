      <h1 id="inves">About me</h1>
      <div id="inves">
      <p>Hello, my name is Josue. I'm passionate about everything I'm interested in, be it the arts, sciences, music, and mythology.</p>
      <p>I'm a lover of Asian culture, especially Japanese culture, including anime, manga, light novels, and J-Pop. I'm also interested in Chinese, Korean, and Filipino culture.</p>  
      <p>Another passion of mine is fantasy. I love medieval or futuristic fantasy stories. I like to imagine I live in the Middle Ages or in a star colony, and this goes hand in hand with another of my passions: music. Every moment of life has a song that fits it perfectly, and there are songs that make me feel like I'm fighting a dragon or piloting a spaceship.</p> 
      <p> Music is what accompanies me every day, whether on public transport or walking down the street. I can never be without my headphones.</p>
      <p>I also love watching horror, crime, and mystery movies and series. I love feeling the intrigue of not knowing what will happen next and seeing how the plot twists will play out, and trying to make my own deductions to see if I can get the right answer.</p>
      <p>Well, that's a little bit about me, but there's still a lot to discover about myself, even for myself.</p>
