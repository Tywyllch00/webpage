    <h2 id="inves">NTN</h2>
    <p id="inves">Non-terrestrial networks (NTN) are wireless communication systems based above the Earth, utilizing platforms high in the air or satellites in orbit. Constellations of NTN satellites in low earth orbit (300-1,500km), medium earth orbit (10,000-20,000km), and geostationary orbit (36,000 km) combine to deliver uninterrupted, global service. High-altitude platforms (HAPs) and drones are also leveraged for non-terrestrial network communication.</p>
    <p id="inves">As 5G NTN standards are solidified through the adoption of 3GPP Release 18 and 19, applications ranging from precision agriculture to ships at sea can leverage NTN coverage. Non-terrestrial networks can also provide options for consumers in need of unlimited roaming capabilities, such as aircraft passengers. With more use cases emerging all the time, the global NTN market size is expected to increase from $4 billion to over $23 billion by 2028.</p>
    <h2 id="inves">6G</h2>
    <p id="inves">6G is the next-generation cellular technology, following 5G and 5G Advanced.
                  It will consist of:</p>
    <ul id="inves">
      <li>Higher frequencies than 5G – from around 6 gigahertz (GHz) of 5G into around 40 GHz in the millimeter-wave, with some anticipating 30-300 GHz and even from 300 GHz to 3 THz range </li>
      <li>Network speed: 6G speed is expected to be 50 times faster than 5G with 6G anticipated to reach rates of up to 1 Tbps compared to theoretical speeds of up to 20 Gbps per second in 5G.</li>
      <li>Enhanced reliability and wider network coverage.</li>
      <li>Lower latency – One of the goals of 6G is to support one microsecond latency communications. This is 1,000 times faster than 5G’s one millisecond latency.</li>
      <li>Network energy efficiency: The goal for 6G is to enhance network energy efficiency by a factor of 100</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="inves">6G will embody connected intelligence, converging communications with AI. Some industry experts envision that it will not simply be an upgrade of 5G but will take the telecom industry to an entirely new level, bridging the divide between the physical and the digital worlds.</p>
    <p id="inves">The industry is already witnessing much activity around 6G. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) finalized the IMT-2030 framework in 2023, releasing its new recommendations for 6G. This was followed in September 2024 by the 3GPP formally approving the first study item for 6G, signifying its move from high-level vision to use cases for 6G, with a projected completion date of 2030.</p>
    <p id="inves">Aside from the standards organizations, many industry collaborations are joining forces to fast-track the future of communications.  A Japanese consortium consisting of Docomo, NTT, NEC, and Fujitsu unveiled the first high-speed 6G prototype device at 100Gbps. Researchers at the University College of London set a new world record for transmitting data at 938 gigabytes per second (Gbps), or almost one terabyte – which is more than 9,000 times faster than the current 5G phone speed.  Meanwhile, the IEEE established a working group for an Innovation Testbed to develop next-generation technologies for 6G.</p>
